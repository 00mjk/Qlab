{"body":"Raytheon BBN Technologies' Qlab\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nA MATLAB framework for superconducting qubit systems.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nTo download or clone the repository, you must first be granted access by a member of the BBN Qlab team. Contact one of us to get access.\r\n\r\nOnce you have access, simply download and unzip the latest release. Or, if you want the tip of the development repository, clone a local copy with\r\n\r\n\tgit clone git@github.com:BBN-Q/Qlab.git localname\r\n\r\nThe code is loosely organized into\r\n\r\n* `analysis/` - routines for data analysis\r\n* `experiment/` - experiment control and measurement\r\n* `common/` - instrument drivers, pulse generation, and general utilities\r\n* `hardware/` - firmware and and non-MATLAB drivers for BBN hardware\r\n\r\nBefore running any of the scripts, add `basedir/common/src` and `basedir/common/src/util` to your MATLAB path. The pulse generation routines in `experiment/muWaveDection/sequences` further depend on setting a MATLAB preference for the path to a pulse configuration file. See the [pulse generation][Pulse-Generation] documentation for details.\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki][] for further help.\r\n\r\nAll source is distributed under the Apache open source [license][].\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPrincipal developers: Blake Johnson (@blakejohnson) and Colm Ryan (@caryan)\r\n\r\n[wiki]: http://github.com/BBN-Q/Qlab/wiki\r\n[Pulse-Generation]: http://github.com/BBN-Q/Qlab/wiki/Pulse-Generation\r\n[license]: http://github.com/BBN-Q/Qlab/blob/master/LICENSE","tagline":"Measurement and control software for superconducting qubits.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
