aps_dac2_r10_p01.bit - Original Version (from MQCO 170)
aps_dac2_r10_p04.bit - Version w/SW Sync, B-A Fix, Latched PLL_INT lock
aps_dac2_r10_p05.bit - Version w/SW Sync, B-A Fix, Latched PLL_INT, PLL02, PLL13 locks
aps_dac2_r10_p06.bit - Corrected dac_if_sm, for initial load (added state 0x0040)
                       Holds one state to insure initial LL values are out and loaded.
aps_dac2_r10_p06.bit - Inverted trig13 signal (per updated schematic)
                       Updated trigger output logic for waveform mode
aps_dac2_r10_p07.bit - Corrected continuous waveform mode operation issues with extra zero outputs.
aps_dac2_r10_p08.bit - Corrected Mini Link List issues with transitions from LLA->LLB, LLB->LLA

(Issues with bit errors)
aps_dac2_r10_p12.bit - intermediate build 1
aps_dac2_r10_p13.bit - intermediate build 2
aps_dac2_r10_p14.bit - Slowed down internal clock from 200 MHz to 150 MHz

(Dual write issues)
aps_dac2_r10_p15.bit - Turns LED off if USB sync (or bad addr) error is detected. (Also, "memlock" disabled)
aps_dac2_r10_p16.bit - Turns LED off if USB sync (or bad addr) error is detected. (Also, "memlock" disabled)
                       Resets w/good write to write address (4 writes)
aps_dac2_r10_p17.bit - p16, but using "rising edge" of CPLD interface clock.
aps_dac2_r10_p20.bit - p17, with added debug header signals
aps_dac2_r10_p25.bit - p20, with debug header signals removed.
                     - Added "on_led" register definition (Trig/LED Register bit 0x0010)
                     - When "on_led" is '0' (default) panel LED = all PLLs locked
                     - When "on_led" is '1' panel LED = either channel is running (state machine not in reset)
aps_dac2_r10_p27.bit - p25, with added logic to insure checksum registers occur only once per cycle
aps_dac2_r10_p28.bit - Added Trigger Offset Registers (0x12, 0x13)
                       Rearranged the TRIG/LED Register bit fields and added "Waveform Mode Output Trigger Enable" bits
                       Added trigger output delay logic (2-stage counter), using the Trigger Offset Registers (LL Mode Only)
