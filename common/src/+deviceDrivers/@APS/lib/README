This directory contains the code to interface to the APS board over USB 
using the FTD2xx.dll link library. The dll may be compiled using the cygwin
toolchain by running make. This library is currently being called from matlab
and the output of stdout and stderr is not visable. Debug output may be written 
to the file lidaps.log by defining DEBUG with #define DEBUG.

The windows version uses the ftd2xx.h header file in ./include. Mac and linux versions 
should use the header files from the driver install.

A note on FTD2xx installation for MacOS. In addition to following the ReadMe file 
from the dmg, copy $DMG/LibTable/build/Debug/libd2xx_table.dylib to /usr/local/lib.
