fab1_p38
- half scale, 12 sample high, 12 sample zero, repeating pulse
- 3.333 ns (1/300 MHz) trigger output.

P178
- Added Trigger Offset Registers (0x12, 0x13)
- Rearranged the TRIG/LED Register bit fields and added "Waveform Mode Output Trigger Enable" bits
- Added trigger output delay logic (2-stage counter), using the Trigger Offset Registers (LL Mode Only) 
P177 (equal to aps_dac2_r10_p08)
- Corrected continuous waveform mode operation issues with extra zero outputs.
- Corrected Mini Link List issues with transitions from LLA->LLB, LLB->LLA
P176
- Corrected dac_if_sm, for initial load (added state 0x0040)
  Holds one state to insure initial LL values are out and loaded.
P174
- Added SW Sync, Latches for PLL_INT, PLL02, PLL13 Lock bits.(top)
P173
- Added B->A LL mod for Continuous mode (dac_sm)
P168_draft
- Added raw phase/lock data to register (top, reg)
P167
- Corrected reset state of Zero Output registers
P166
- Added missing bit flipping for Zero Output registers.
P165
- Changed CSR bits 3 and 10 from "Output Enable" to "DDR Enable"
P162
- Added Write Cycle Address Checksum register to CSR offset 0x00D
- Added Write Cycle Data Checksum register to CSR offset 0x00E
- Added Zero Output register for channels 02 to CSR offset 0x010
- Added Zero Output register for channels 13 to CSR offset 0x011
P161
- Ties DDR reset to "csr(0)" (State Machine Reset)
P160
- Ties DDR reset to "pllxx_lock"
P159
- Ties DDR reset to FPGA_RSTN versus "not pll_rst"
P156
- Fixed data_fix() to match schematic (schematic is not up to date)
P155
- Rebuilt with pll200_int = 220 MHz defined
- Improved write reliability.
P154
- Fixed external trigger logic for P151
P151
- Fixed the hardware trigger logic to P150
P150
P149
- Changed Phase data to work with existing system software. 
P146
- Has new 300-to-200 MHz PLL added
- 300 MHz used for phase test reference
- 200 MHz used for second stage synchronous logic
P138
- DDR Reset changed to be set to the inverse of PLL Reset
P137
- tied DDR reset to PLL reset, so that the DDR block is reset whenever the PLLs are reset.
Note: PLL Reset is active low, DDR Reset is active high. Build did not work.
P136
- removed clearing of a trigger if it wasn't processed.
- when both are restarted, they may start at the wrong time relative to the first trigger, but will synch up on the next one.
P134
- isolated channel 02 and 13 trigger inputs.
- removed 2 stage (one for each clock) trigger pipeline logic
- changed the CSR synch latch logic to a single latch
Changes in inter-channel phase skew was evident when the combined channels were disabled and re-triggered
P130
- added both trig_02_en AND trig_13_en to the External Trigger Pulse logic for both channels
This change was made to insure that one channel was not missing a trigger while the other channel caught it, due to asynchronous first trigger.  Didn't make any noticable improvements.
P127
- disconnected the ddr reset lines from the state machine enable bit
- tied the ddr reset lines to an inverted version of FPGA_RSTN
When state machine was in reset, DDR logic drove 0x0000 to DAC, causing DC offsets on the DAC outputs due to FPGA +/- pin swaps implemented during board routing
