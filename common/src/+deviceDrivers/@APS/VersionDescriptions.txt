P161
- Ties DDR reset to "csr(0)" (State Machine Reset)
P160
- Ties DDR reset to "pllxx_lock"
P159
- Ties DDR reset to FPGA_RSTN versus "not pll_rst"
P156
- Fixed data_fix() to match schematic (schematic is not up to date)
P155
- Rebuilt with pll200_int = 220 MHz defined
- Improved write reliability.
P154
- Fixed external trigger logic for P151
P151
- Fixed the hardware trigger logic to P150
P150
P149
- Changed Phase data to work with existing system software. 
P146
- Has new 300-to-200 MHz PLL added
- 300 MHz used for phase test reference
- 200 MHz used for second stage synchronous logic
P138
- DDR Reset changed to be set to the inverse of PLL Reset
P137
- tied DDR reset to PLL reset, so that the DDR block is reset whenever the PLLs are reset.
Note: PLL Reset is active low, DDR Reset is active high. Build did not work.
P136
- removed clearing of a trigger if it wasn't processed.
- when both are restarted, they may start at the wrong time relative to the first trigger, but will synch up on the next one.
P134
- isolated channel 02 and 13 trigger inputs.
- removed 2 stage (one for each clock) trigger pipeline logic
- changed the CSR synch latch logic to a single latch
Changes in inter-channel phase skew was evident when the combined channels were disabled and re-triggered
P130
- added both trig_02_en AND trig_13_en to the External Trigger Pulse logic for both channels
This change was made to insure that one channel was not missing a trigger while the other channel caught it, due to asynchronous first trigger.  Didn't make any noticable improvements.
P127
- disconnected the ddr reset lines from the state machine enable bit
- tied the ddr reset lines to an inverted version of FPGA_RSTN
When state machine was in reset, DDR logic drove 0x0000 to DAC, causing DC offsets on the DAC outputs due to FPGA +/- pin swaps implemented during board routing
