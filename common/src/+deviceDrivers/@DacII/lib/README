* Revision 1.2  2008/11/21 19:18:52  bdonovan
* Ported dacii library to MacOS and Linux.
* Matlab code updated to check for OS.
* Removed Matlab R2008 specific object features.
*
* Revision 1.1  2008/10/23 20:41:35  bdonovan
* First version of CMD Builder GUI that uses C dll to communicate with DACII board.
*
* C library to communicate with board is in ./lib.
*
* Matlab code has been reorganized into classes. GUI is not edited with the guide command
* in matlab.
*
* Independent triggering of each of the 4 DACs has been confirmed for both software
*  and hardware triggering with cbl_dac2_r3beta.bit

This directory contains the code to interface to the DACII board over USB 
using the FTD2xx.dll link library. The dll may be compiled using the cygwin
toolchain by running make. This library is currently being called from matlab
and the output of stdout and stderr is not visable. Debug output may be written 
to the file liddacii.log by defining DEBUG with #define DEBUG.

The windows version uses the ftd2xx.h header file in ./include. Mac and linux versions 
should use the header files from the driver install.

A note on FTD2xx installation for MacOS. In addition to following the ReadMe file 
from the dmg, copy $DMG/LibTable/build/Debug/libd2xx_table.dylib to /usr/local/lib.
